* Logged parameters
The following data should be logged at the maximum (reasonable)
frequency:

1. Acceleration in x,y,z direction [m/s^2]
2. Gyro rate of rotation around x,y,z [rad/s] 
3. GPS speed and location [m/s, long-lat]
4. Orientation - yaw, roll, pith [rad]


* Normal operation
These maneuvers shall be possible without triggering false positives.

** Acceleration from standstill
Perform rapid acceleration from 0 – 100km/h.

** Deceleration to standstill
Perform rapid acceleration from 0 – 100km/h. Rear brake vs front brake
vs rear-front braking, please specify in notes column. Perform with
locked rear brake for some runs.

** Driving over manhole covers, potholes, bumps
Longitudinal acceleration due to bumps and potholes seem to pose the
biggest challenge. A variety of road conditions should be tested at a
variety of speed. Please provide specification of test in the notes column.

* Advanced Operation
These maneuvers should be possible without triggering false positives
** Slalom, figure 8s
More advanced maneuvers generating greater lateral acceleration.

* Basic Crash Tests
These maneuvers shall trigger spline.

* Advanced Crash Tests
These maneuvers should trigger spline.
