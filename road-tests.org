* Logged parameters
The following data should be logged at the maximum (reasonable)
frequency:

1. Acceleration in x,y,z direction [m/s^2]
2. Gyro rate of rotation around x,y,z [rad/s] 
3. GPS speed and location [m/s, long-lat]
4. Orientation - yaw, roll, pith [rad]


* Normal operation
These maneuvers shall be possible without triggering false positives.

** Acceleration from standstill
Perform rapid acceleration from 0 – 100km/h.

** Deceleration to standstill
Perform rapid acceleration from 0 – 100km/h. Rear brake vs front brake
vs rear-front braking, please specify in notes column. Perform with
locked rear brake for some runs.

Perform with locked rear brake for some runs.

** Driving over manhole covers, potholes, bumps
Longitudinal acceleration due to bumps and potholes seem to pose the
biggest challenge. A variety of road conditions should be tested at a
variety of speed. Please provide specification of test in the notes column.

Chopping the throttle following acceleration (preferably at full throttle).

* Advanced Operation
These maneuvers should be possible without triggering false positives
** Slalom, figure 8s
More advanced maneuvers generating greater lateral acceleration.

* Basic Crash Tests
These maneuvers shall trigger spline.
** Stationary ego vehicle, impact with moving object (car)
Hit target in 45 degree increments and varying speeds. Special care
should be take simulating rear-enders and front impacts.

* Advanced Crash Tests
These maneuvers should trigger spline. They will be hard to replicate but we should see it in perspective of the hurt report statistics:

1. 75% of accidents were found to involve a motorcycle and a passenger
   vehicle, while the remaining 25% of accidents were single
   motorcycle accidents.
2. In the single vehicle accidents, motorcycle rider error was present
   as the accident precipitating factor in about two-thirds of the
   cases, with the typical error being a slide-out and fall due to
   overbraking or running wide on a curve due to excess speed or
   under-cornering.
